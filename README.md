# Rplots_from_ColumbusAnalysis

This Repo contains some R Markdown files that were used for plotting data in R Studio. 

The data is included in the "datasets" folder and consists of excel files. 

Each excel file is the result of a Batch Analysis done with the Columbus Software after imaging with PerkinElemer high-throughput Opera Phenix microscope.

The Markdown files will allow you to use the great features of R studio and ggplot for plotting various features of the datasets.
